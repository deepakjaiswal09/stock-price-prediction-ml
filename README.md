# Stock Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview

Stock price prediction is a challenging and fascinating problem in the financial domain. Stocks represent ownership shares in companies, and their prices fluctuate daily based on supply and demand forces in the market. While many believe stock prices are inherently unpredictable, advances in machine learning have shown promising results in forecasting stock trends using historical data.

This project focuses on predicting Google stock prices by leveraging technical analysis and deep learning models, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to capture temporal dependencies in the data.

## Why This Project?

- Stock markets are volatile and can change rapidly, making accurate prediction crucial for investors.
- Traditional fundamental analysis is complex; technical analysis through historical price data provides an alternative.
- Machine learning, especially deep learning models like LSTM, can identify patterns from sequential data effectively.
- This project demonstrates practical application of LSTM for stock price forecasting with clear visualization and evaluation.

## Key Concepts and Methods

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the stock price dataset for modeling.
- **Feature Scaling:** Normalizing data to improve model performance.
- **Dataset Preparation:** Creating training and test sets suitable for time-series prediction.
- **Model Architecture:** Implementing sequential models using dense layers, LSTM units, and dropout for regularization.
- **Training and Evaluation:** Training the model on historical data and validating its predictive accuracy.
- **Visualization:** Plotting actual vs predicted stock prices to assess model effectiveness.
